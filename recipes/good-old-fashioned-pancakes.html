      <h2>Pancake Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe.
        If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Flour:</b> This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose
          flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Baking powder:</b> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to
          fluffy pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sugar:</b> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for
          subtly sweet pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Salt:</b> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without
          making your pancakes taste salty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Milk and butter:</b> Milk and butter add moisture and richness to
          the pancakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Egg:</b> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind
          the pancake batter together.
        </li>
      </ul>
