      <h2>Banana Bread Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief
        overview of what you can expect when you make this simple banana bread:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Baking soda:</b> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it
          helps the banana bread rise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Salt:</b> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't
          make the loaf taste salty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Butter:</b> A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and
          irresistible flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Brown sugar:</b> Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of
          warmth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Eggs:</b> Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the
          batter together.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bananas:</b> Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe
          bananas.
        </li>
      </ul>
